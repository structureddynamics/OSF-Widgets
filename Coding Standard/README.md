Additionally, these standards are enforced by PolyStyle.

The the AS3 style suite (PolyStyle, see http://polystyle.com) used to format the code of the Semantic Component

To use PolyStyle, you have to unzip the file StructuredDynamics_v_0_1-style-as3.zip into the 
folder "/polystyle/examples/.../" to make it available to PolyStyle to format your PHP files according 
to this coding standard.
